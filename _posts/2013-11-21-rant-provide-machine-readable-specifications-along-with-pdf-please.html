     I just got access to the <a href="http://www.ifap.ed.gov/appprocspecsswd/1314AppProcSysSoftwareDevSpecsAugust2013Update.html">Application Processing System Specifications for Software Developers</a>, to support designing of an API interface. This document is critical for me, providing me with all the questions and supporting business logic for the API.
</p>
<p>
     I will get to work on extracting a data model and API design draft, something I will generate a backend for, and start building some client tooling, while I also hammer into shape the first version of the FAFSA API.
</p>
<p>
     Before I get started I just wanted to bitch a little bit about what a pain in the ass it is for me to extract what I need from a PDF. When I'm done I will send back the PDF to those who created it and provide a machine readable version of the document, that maybe…then could use for next year's specification.
</p>
<p>
     PDF's were not made for this, JSON and XML were.
